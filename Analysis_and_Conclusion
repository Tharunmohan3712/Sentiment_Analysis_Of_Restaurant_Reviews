# Analysis and Conclusion

In this study, an attempt has been made to classify sentiment analysis for restaurant reviews using machine learning techniques. Two algorithms namely Multinomial Naive Bayes and Bernoulli Naive Bayes are implemented.

Evaluation metrics used here are accuracy, precision and recall.

Using Multinomial Naive Bayes,

- Accuracy of prediction is 77.67%.
- Precision of prediction is 0.78.
- Recall of prediction is 0.77.
  
Using Bernoulli Naive Bayes,

- Accuracy of prediction is 77.0%.
- Precision of prediction is 0.76.
- Recall of prediction is 0.78.

Using Logistic Regression,

- Accuracy of prediction is 76.67%.
- Precision of prediction is 0.8.
- Recall of prediction is 0.71.
  
From the above results, Multinomial Naive Bayes is slightly better method compared to Bernoulli Naive Bayes and Logistic Regression, with 77.67% accuracy which means the model built for the prediction of sentiment of the restaurant review gives 77.67% right prediction.
